                Back in 2016, I started my journey in software development began
                after securing admission in a Software Engineering undergraduate
                program. Since then, I've had the opportunity to work on a
                variety of projects, from web applications to complex backend
                systems and APIs. I enjoy the challenge of solving intricate
                problems and turning innovative ideas into functional software.

                With a strong foundation in coding and a keen eye for design, I
                thrive on crafting intuitive and visually appealing software
                experiences. My journey in the world of web development has been
                a constant exploration of the latest technologies and trends. In
                my free time, I focus on expanding my skill set by learning the
                latest trends and technologies in software development.

                Apart from computers, I also love cooking, reading, strength
                training, and spending time with my friends and family. These
                few things pretty much sum up my whole life.
